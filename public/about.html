<p>Hello! My name is Ioannis, and i am a hardworking and adaptable Junior Java Developer passionate
  about learning new skills and solving complex problems. I thrive one creating projects from scratch,
  making them both functional and visually appealing. My professional focus lies in Spring Boot, RESTful APIs,
  and PostgreSQL, Which i use to build robust and scalable backend systems.

<p>Beyond my technical skills, my greatest pride and joy are my two wonderful kids, who inspire me every day to be the best version of myself. Professionally, I’m proud of the three projects I’m working on: 
  a collaborative Music Box application, a secure and user-friendly Online Banking System, 
  and an E-commerce platform on GitHub that combines my love for technology and business innovation.</p>

  <p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy gaming, especially strategy games like Total War: Warhammer 3, 
    and streaming under my Twitch username, NexaQuest. I’m always eager to explore new technologies, 
    improve my skills, and connect with like-minded individuals in the tech community.</p>
